                <h2>Noise Pollution</h2>
                <p>
                    Noise pollution, also known as sound pollution, is the excessive and unwanted sound that can have
                    negative effects on human health and the environment. It can come from various sources such as
                    transportation, industrial activities, construction and even from natural sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that noise pollution can have a range of negative effects on human health,
                    including sleep disturbance, cardiovascular disease, and hearing loss. It can also have negative
                    impacts on wildlife and their habitat, including changes in behavior and breeding patterns.
                    Therefore, it's crucial to prevent noise pollution in the first place.
